Easy to use after setting all moveit configuration.

Getting the pose and dimension from my the other project: [ROSnoetics_multiple_category_level_detectors](https://github.com/Tianyi20/category-level-estimation-ROS-noetic)

After receiving the pose and dimension, convert the pouring action porblem to a optimisation problem:

The optimizer is solved by scipy
